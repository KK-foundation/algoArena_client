# AlgoArena: Conquer the Code

## Overview

AlgoArena is a modern web application designed to help developers enhance their problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews. It provides a platform to practice coding challenges, participate in live contests, track progress, and engage with a community of fellow coders. Think of it as a sleeker, more engaging alternative to LeetCode.

## Key Features

- **Problem Solving:** A diverse collection of algorithm and data structure problems with varying difficulty levels.
- **Live Contests:** Participate in timed coding competitions to test your skills against other developers.
- **Progress Tracking:** Monitor your coding activity, track solved problems, and visualize your learning journey.
- **Community Engagement:** Connect with other developers, share solutions, and participate in discussions.
- **Interactive Code Editor:** Write and test your code directly in the browser with support for multiple programming languages.
- **Personalized Profile:** Showcase your achievements, badges, and coding statistics.
- **Problem Sheets:** Create and manage custom problem lists for focused practice.
- **Interview Simulation:** Practice technical interviews with a simulated environment, including video and audio support.
- **Leaderboard:** Compete with other users and track your ranking.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - React
  - TypeScript
  - Tailwind CSS
  - shadcn/ui
  - Zustand
  - React Hook Form
  - React Query
  - Monaco Editor
  - Framer Motion
- **Backend:** (This section assumes you have a backend, adjust accordingly)
  - Node.js
  - Express
  - PostgreSQL (example, replace with your actual database)
  - [Other backend technologies]

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version >= 18)
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL (if applicable)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd algoArena_client
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

3.  Configure environment variables:

    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying `.env.example` (if it exists) and modifying it with your actual values.
    - Add the necessary environment variables (e.g., API keys, database connection strings).

4.  Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev # or yarn dev
    ```

    The application should now be running at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified in your Vite configuration).
